# Steam Summer Monster Game Sale 2015
## -- Not affiliated with Steam, no intended or implied affiliation.

Usage instructions:
> node main.js
> use webbrowser to hit: http://localhost/main.html
> click and kill monsters

Supported features:
* Database automatically stores players, game, level, monsters and upgrades.
* Players can level up when clearing levels, just as the steam game allowed for when it was live.
* Players can purchase upgrades
* Boss levels appear on every 10th level, goldhelm level appears on 100th level
* Treasure map appears at a 3% chance


Not working yet:
* Only singleplayer - this shouldn't be hard to rig up now that I've done the database
* Not all upgrades work, I've coded in the click damage/DPS/health upgrades but not the other crit damage/elemental damage ones
* Monster stats (HP/Gold/Damage) aren't right, I need to watch some videos to try get all this.  You can help by going to the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/SMGCS/ and posting what you know!
* Probably a whole lot more that I can't think of right now...


If people can help with the neatness of the code, that'd be nice - that's what I'm going to try start working on now :)
